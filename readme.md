the default color is blue if the color has not been chosen. 

to create a triangle, first choose the color otherwise default color(blue) will be applied, press the mouse(first vertex) and drag it to wherever on the screen except pallet area (second vertex) and release the mouse (create first line of triangle). and if you do press and drag mouse again(the starting point of second line will be the end point of first line), it will create triangle.    

to drag the vertex of the existent triangle, need to pressed enough close spot (I gave 20 distances from mouse position for this) which must be inside of triangle as well. 

if the mouse is pressed on screen but outside of all drawn triangles, it recognizes that point as starting vertex of a new triangle to be created.
